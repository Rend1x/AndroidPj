Standard Control Warrior is the quintessential control deck that picks up value through weapon removal in the early stages of the game.

The Warrior uses low-cost cards like Acolyte of Pain to cycle through his deck into big threats. The Warrior's Hero Power and cheap removals provide incredible early-game sustainability to stall for the late-game-focused mana curve. Entering into the late game, the Warrior aims to overwhelm his opponent with heavy-hitting late-game minions.

Opponents often expect the Warrior to be playing a Pirate variant, which gives the Control Warrior an element of surprise.
