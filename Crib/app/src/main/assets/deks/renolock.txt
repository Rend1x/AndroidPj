Renolock is a variant of the classic Handlock, which uses Life Tap to gain early card advantage. The deck normally consists of 30 different cards so you can reliably play Reno Jackson at any time. The ability to heal back to full life is great against any opponent, whether they are an aggro or control deck.

The deck comes in two very different variants: Combo or Control. Combo Renolock relies on Leeroy Jenkins, Power Overwhelming, and Faceless Manipulator to push out 20 damage in a single turn. Control Renolock uses card advantage and Lord Jaraxxus to win in the late game.
