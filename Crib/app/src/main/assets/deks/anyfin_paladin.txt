Anyfin Paladin is a murloc deck that makes use of the card Anyfin Can Happen to generate a board full of buffed, charging murlocs to kill the opponent. The deck's gameplan is to survive during the early game, draw during the mid-game, and finish with a burst of damage in the late game.

The arrival of Ivory Knight from Karazhan has helped the deck gain consistency, as it can discover another Anyfin Can Happen, increasing the odds of playing it at turn 10 or improving the matchup further against the control decks. The deck often packs only two different murlocs: Bluegill Warrior and Murloc Warleader, while filling the rest of the deck with draw, removal, and healing methods.

With the release of Mean Street of Gadgetzan, some Anyfin Paladin decks may feature Finja, the Flying Star in order to draw the two required murlocs while giving up some burst potential from Anyfin Can Happen.

Anyfin Paladin manages to survive against the onslaught of aggressive decks with healing from cards such as Forbidden Healing and Truesilver Champion, while also out-valuing the Control Decks with Anyfin Can Happen, making it a dynamic and versatile choice in the meta.
