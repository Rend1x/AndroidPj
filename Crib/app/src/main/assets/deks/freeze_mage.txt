Freeze Mage is a combo deck that has been around since the beginning of Hearthstone. In the most simple terms possible, Freeze Mage revolves around cycling through your deck, drawing Alexstrasza, and then using burn spells to kill your opponent.

While the meta has evolved throughout the years, we have now settled on Forgotten Torches to get the damage you need for lethal. Forgotten Torch gives you the advantage of adding additional burn to your deck, so sometimes you don't even need Alexstrasza to make lethal. Overall, Freeze Mage is a very versatile and strong deck, but can be complex to execute properly.
