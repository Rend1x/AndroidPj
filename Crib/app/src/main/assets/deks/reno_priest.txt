Reno Priest is a deck based around Reno Jackson and Kazakus in order to take advantage of the various conditional spells available in the Priest class. The Reno Priest often comes in different variations, making use of different card shells such as the Dragon package or the Inspire package. Mean Streets of Gadgetzan gave Reno Priest a much-needed boost in the form of Kazakus and Raza the Chained, allowing it to survive better in the early- to mid-game while getting immense value in the late game.

Reno Priest also aims to utilize the Priest hero power in order to delay the Reno Jackson turn as long as they can, increasing the value obtained by it. Reno Priest is often built as a control deck, although the tools to make it a combo-oriented deck are there with the Inspire package, with the help of Raza the Chained.

Contesting early game with spot removal, clearing board in mid-game, and getting value from spells and minions during late game is the core game plan of Reno Priest. Playing around burst from different decks and utilizing the singleton spells available in the deck is extremely important to have success with Reno Priest.
