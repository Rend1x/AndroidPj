Control Shaman plays very differently than the other Shaman decks, which are all very early-board-oriented. As Control Shaman, you play a more laid-back kind of game, as you sit back and use your removal to keep the board clean.

The deck plays so many heals, so it is okay to take some damage while you set up a good area-of-effect to clear the board. The AoE is key to the gameplay because it is where you get your card advantage by trading them for two or more cards. Then, you use big legendaries and N’Zoth to close out the game.
