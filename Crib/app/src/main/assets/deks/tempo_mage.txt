Tempo Mage utilizes spell synergy with Mana Wyrm, Sorcerer's Apprentice, Arcane Missiles, and Flamewaker to seize tempo early, essentially bullying your opponent past the point of recovery.

Typically, Tempo Mage closes out the game fairly quickly with burn spells synergizing with recurring damage from Mana Wyrm and bonus RNG damage from Flamewaker. While the goal is to close out the game relatively early, some Tempo Mage decks may opt to curve into late-game threats like Archmage Antonidas.
