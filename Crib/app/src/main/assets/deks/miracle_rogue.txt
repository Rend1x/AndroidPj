The old favorite has returned in Miracle Rogue, the classic combo deck using Gadgetzan Auctioneer to draw through the whole of your deck to your win condition. The burst damage this deck offers is deadly indeed, with a mixture of spells including Cold Blood, Eviscerate, and Deadly Poison giving you the damage you need to kill your opponent.

The new cards from the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, Patches the Pirate, Small-Time Buccaneer, and Counterfeit Coin have found their value in Miracle Rogue. With the combination of Pirate synergy and an additional Coin, now Miracle Rogue has a much better early curve and also earlier Gadgetzan Auctioneer turns.
