Dragon Priest is a mid-range deck that makes use of the dragon tribal synergy in order to snowball the board from the early- to mid-game with over-statted minions. Dragon Priest relies on trading efficiently with minions in conjunction with the Lesser Heal hero power to get early board control.

The release of the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan also gave Dragon Priest a huge boost with the Drakonid Operative and Dragonfire Potion, allowing it to go toe-to-toe against even the most late-game-oriented decks if needed.

The primary plan of Dragon Priest is to get a solid lead in the mid-game and beat down the opponent with solid mid-game creatures. Powerful on-curve plays from the early- to mid-game and the ability to generate value with discover effects is what makes Dragon Priest a solid choice in the meta.
