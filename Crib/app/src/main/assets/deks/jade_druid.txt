Jade Druid is a powerful tempo deck built around synergistic cards to repetitively summon Jade Golem, which gain +1/+1 everytime it gets summoned until reaching a maximum of 30/30.

Jade Idol, with one of its "Choose One" effects to be "Shuffle 3 copies of this card into your deck," allows Jade Druid to summon infinite Jade Golems in one game and avoid any fatigue damage, and single-handedly establishes extreme advantage against slow control decks like Control Warrior.

Jade Druid is a total meta changer that has killed most old-fashioned control decks not running huge burst damage, and is also the culprit of this aggro meta.
