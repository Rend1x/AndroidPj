Pirate Rogue is a highly-aggressive deck similar to other kinds of infamous aggro decks like Aggro Shaman. This deck relies on early- and mid-game tempo plays to value trade in the first 3-5 turns, then go face with everything, including direct damage such as Cold Blood and Eviscerate. The aim of this deck is to out-tempo your opponent by quickly flooding the board with small but aggressive early drops, then try to finish the game within 7 turns by rushing opponent's face.

The typical turn when you should directly ignore any enemy minions is when the combination of your board, hand, and potential top-deck damage is enough for setting up three-turn lethal, which is usually turn 4 or 5. Staying aggressive and not playing around every possible board clear of your opponent is very important, as you are going to run out of steam very quickly and have a smaller and smaller chance to win as the game prolongs.
