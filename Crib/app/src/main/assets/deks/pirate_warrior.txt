Pirate Warrior is an aggressive Warrior variant that utilizes Pirate synergy for a strong early board. Coupled with a few of warrior's "burn" spells and weapons, Pirate Warrior can easily start an aggressive onslaught. As a hyper-aggressive deck, the Pirate Warrior generally seeks to close out games before turn 7-8.

Even though Pirate Warrior now lacks an element of surprise, it makes up for it with a boost in strength to its early game.
