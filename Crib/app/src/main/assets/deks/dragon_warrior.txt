Dragon Warrior is a mid-range Warrior build that utilizes dragon synergy and weapons to gain control of the board. It relies heavily on its powerful on-curve plays to maintain tempo into its late-game turns. Big threats such as Drakonid Crusher, Grommash Hellscream, Malkorok, and Ragnaros the Firelord are options that leave Dragon Warrior with a strong mid-late game win condition.
