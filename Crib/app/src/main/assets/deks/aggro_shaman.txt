Aggro Shaman is a deck with one of the best early games. It has everything from early minions like Small Time Buccaneer and Tunnel Trogg to early weapons in Spirit Claws and Jade Claws. It tries to snowball this early pressure to put together enough damage to get the opponent in burn range.

Flamewreath Faceless is a finisher in all variations of Aggro Shaman, but others can also play Doomhammer and Aya Blackpaw as additional threats to close the game out.

The deck wants to close out the game as fast as possible, normally in the first 8 turns. It puts on early pressure with the many low-cost cards that the deck runs. Tunnel Trogg into Totem Golem is still one of the best starts of the game, but Small Time Buccaneer into Jade Claws can be equally back-breaking. Jade Lightning is one of the better mid-game cards at taking the board because it both removes AND develops a minion.
