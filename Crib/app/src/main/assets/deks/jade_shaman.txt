Mid-Range Shaman is a deck that tries to take an early lead on the board by using its early minions and weapons. It can be classic or Jade variants, but they start the game similarly – they try to get to the late game having a board, and close the game out with either a Thunder Bluff Valiant, a Bloodlust, or an 8-mana Legendary in Ragnaros the Firelord or Al’Akir the Windlord. Jade Shamans are more likely to lean on Bloodlust, while classic Mid-Range plays Thunder Bluff and big Legendaries.

The deck can have an Aggro Shaman-like start with the early pressure with Tunnel Trogg, Totem Golem, and Feral Spirits. It uses Spirit Claws or Jade Claws (if it’s the Jade variant) to control the board early, while also developing your own. If you are playing Jade synergy, the mid-game is where you want to Jade Lightning a minion – you take tempo by also being able to develop a minion with the same card.
