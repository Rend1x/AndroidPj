Reno Mage is a new deck that has developed with the release of Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, as it gained new support from the card Kazakus, on top of making use of the very powerful Reno Jackson.

Reno Mage is played with the late game in mind, spending the early game fighting for board and surviving until it can take control of the game with either a Reno Jackson saving your life or other various win conditions in the control matchups, such as Kazakus comboed with Brann Bronzebeard.

This deck can be built two ways – the more classic control shell that runs only singletons, and the Freeze Mage shell which runs doubles of a few cards.
